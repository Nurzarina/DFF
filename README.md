# D Flip-Flop Verilog Project
## Overview
This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a D Flip-Flop along with a testbench for simulation. The D Flip-Flop is a fundamental memory element in digital electronics, used extensively in registers, counters, and various sequential circuits.

## Features
- **D Flip-Flop Implementation**: Synchronous D Flip-Flop with asynchronous reset.
- **Testbench**: A comprehensive testbench to verify the functionality of the D Flip-Flop.
- **Simulation**: Utilizes Icarus Verilog for simulation and GTKWave for waveform visualization.

## Tools Used
- **Verilog**: The hardware description language used for designing the D Flip-Flop.
- **Icarus Verilog**: A simulator for Verilog code.
- **GTKWave**: A waveform viewer to visualize the simulation results.
- **Docker**: Used to create a consistent development environment.
- **VS Code**: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding.
